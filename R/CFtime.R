#' @title CFTime class
#'
#' @description This class manages the "time" dimension of netCDF files that
#' follow the CF Metadata Conventions, and its productive use in R.
#'
#' The class has a field `cal` which holds a specific calendar from the
#' allowed types (9 named calendars are currently supported). The calendar is
#' also implemented as a (hidden) class which converts netCDF file encodings to
#' timestamps as character strings, and vice-versa. Bounds information (the
#' period of time over which a timestamp is valid) is used when defined in the
#' netCDF file.
#'
#' Additionally, this class has functions to ease use of the netCDF "time"
#' information when processing data from netCDF files. Filtering and indexing of
#' time values is supported, as is the generation of factors.

    #'   For the "proleptic_gregorian" calendar the output can also be generated

    #' @description Format timestamps using a specific format string, using the
    #'   specifiers defined for the [base::strptime()] function, with
    #'   limitations. The only supported specifiers are `bBdeFhHImMpRSTYz%`.
    #'   Modifiers `E` and `O` are silently ignored. Other specifiers, including
    #'   their percent sign, are copied to the output as if they were adorning
    #'   text.
    #'
    #'   The formatting is largely oblivious to locale. The reason for this is
    #'   that certain dates in certain calendars are not POSIX-compliant and the
    #'   system functions necessary for locale information thus do not work
    #'   consistently. The main exception to this is the (abbreviated) names of
    #'   months (`bB`), which could be useful for pretty printing in the local
    #'   language. For separators and other locale-specific adornments, use
    #'   local knowledge instead of depending on system locale settings; e.g.
    #'   specify `%m/%d/%Y` instead of `%D`.
    #'
    #'   Week information, including weekday names, is not supported at all as a
    #'   "week" is not defined for non-standard CF calendars and not generally
    #'   useful for climate projection data. If you are working with observed
    #'   data and want to get pretty week formats, use the [as_timestamp()]
    #'   method to generate `POSIXct` timestamps (observed data generally uses a
    #'   "standard" calendar) and then use the [base::format()] function which
    #'   supports the full set of specifiers.
    #'
    #' @param format A character string with `strptime` format specifiers. If
    #'   omitted, the most economical format will be used: a full timestamp when
    #'   time information is available, a date otherwise.

    #'   the latest values in the time series will be returned as
    #'   `.Machine$integer.max`. Alternatively, when `x` is a numeric vector of
    #'   index values, return the valid indices of the same vector, with the
    #'   side effect being the attribute "CFTime" associated with the result.
    #'
    #'   Matching also returns index values for timestamps that fall between two
    #'   elements of the time series - this can lead to surprising results when
    #'   time series elements are positioned in the middle of an interval (as
    #'   the CF Metadata Conventions instruct us to "reasonably assume"): a time
    #'   series of days in January would be encoded in a netCDF file as
    #'   `c("2024-01-01 12:00:00", "2024-01-02 12:00:00", "2024-01-03 12:00:00", ...)`
    #'   so `x <- c("2024-01-01", "2024-01-02", "2024-01-03")` would
    #'   result in `(NA, 1, 2)` (or `(NA, 1.5, 2.5)` with `method = "linear"`)
    #'   because the date values in `x` are at midnight. This situation is
    #'   easily avoided by ensuring that this `CFTime` instance has bounds set
    #'   (use `bounds(y) <- TRUE` as a proximate solution if bounds are not
    #'   stored in the netCDF file). See the Examples.
    #'
    #'   If bounds are set, the indices are taken from those bounds. Returned
    #'   indices may fall in between bounds if the latter are not contiguous,
    #'   with the exception of the extreme values in `x`.

    #'   Values of `x` that are not valid timestamps according to the calendar
    #'   of this `CFTime` instance will be returned as `NA`.

    #'   valid values in `x` are returned. If negative values are passed, the
    #'   positive counterparts will be excluded and then the remainder returned.
    #'   Positive and negative values may not be mixed. Using a numeric vector
    #'   has the side effect that the result has the attribute "CFTime"
    #'   describing the temporal dimension of the slice. If index values outside
    #'   of the range of `self` are provided, an error will be thrown.

    #' @description Create a factor for a `CFTime` instance.
    #'
    #'   When argument `breaks` is one of `"year", "season", "quarter", "month",
    #'   "dekad", "day"`, a factor is generated like by [CFfactor()]. When
    #'   `breaks` is a vector of character timestamps a factor is produced with
    #'   a level for every interval between timestamps. The last timestamp,
    #'   therefore, is only used to close the interval started by the
    #'   pen-ultimate timestamp - use a distant timestamp (e.g. `range(x)[2]`)
    #'   to ensure that all offsets to the end of the CFTime time series are
    #'   included, if so desired. The last timestamp will become the upper bound
    #'   in the `CFTime` instance that is returned as an attribute to this
    #'   function so a sensible value for the last timestamp is advisable.
    #'
    #'   This method works similar to [base::cut.POSIXt()] but there are some
    #'   differences in the arguments: for `breaks` the set of options is
    #'   different and no preceding integer is allowed, `labels` are always
    #'   assigned using values of `breaks`, and the interval is always
    #'   left-closed.
    #'
    #' @param breaks A character string of a factor period (see [CFfactor()] for
    #'   a description), or a character vector of timestamps that conform to the
    #'   calendar of `x`, with a length of at least 2. Timestamps must be given
    #'   in ISO8601 format, e.g. "2024-04-10 21:31:43".
    #'
    #' @return A factor with levels according to the `breaks` argument, with
    #'   attributes 'period', 'era' and 'CFTime'. When `breaks` is a factor
    #'   period, attribute 'period' has that value, otherwise it is '"day"'.
    #'   When `breaks` is a character vector of timestamps, attribute 'CFTime'
    #'   holds an instance of `CFTime` that has the same definition as `x`, but
    #'   with (ordered) offsets generated from the `breaks`. Attribute 'era'

    #' @description Generate a factor for the offsets, or a part thereof. This is
    #' specifically interesting for creating factors from the date part of the
    #' time series that aggregate the time series into longer time periods (such
    #' as month) that can then be used to process daily CF data sets using, for
    #' instance, `tapply()`.
    #'
    #' The factor will respect the calendar that the time series is built on.
    #'
    #' The factor will be generated in the order of the offsets. While typical
    #' CF-compliant data sources use ordered time series there is, however, no
    #' guarantee that the factor is ordered. For most processing with a factor
    #' the ordering is of no concern.
    #'
    #' If the `era` parameter is specified, either as a vector of years to
    #' include in the factor, or as a list of such vectors, the factor will only
    #' consider those values in the time series that fall within the list of
    #' years, inclusive of boundary values. Other values in the factor will be
    #' set to `NA`. The years need not be contiguous, within a single vector or
    #' among the list items, or in order.
    #'
    #' The following periods are supported by this method:
    #'
    #' \itemize{
    #'   \item `year`, the year of each offset is returned as "YYYY".
    #'   \item `season`, the meteorological season of each offset is returned as
    #'   "Sx", with x being 1-4, preceeded by "YYYY" if no `era` is
    #'   specified. Note that December dates are labeled as belonging to the
    #'   subsequent year, so the date "2020-12-01" yields "2021S1". This implies
    #'   that for standard CMIP files having one or more full years of data the
    #'   first season will have data for the first two months (January and
    #'   February), while the final season will have only a single month of data
    #'   (December).
    #'   \item `quarter`, the calendar quarter of each offset is returned as "Qx",
    #'   with x being 1-4, preceeded by "YYYY" if no `era` is specified.
    #'   \item `month`, the month of each offset is returned as "01" to
    #'   "12", preceeded by "YYYY-" if no `era` is specified. This is the default
    #'   period.
    #'   \item `dekad`, ten-day periods are returned as
    #'   "Dxx", where xx runs from "01" to "36", preceeded by "YYYY" if no `era`
    #'   is specified. Each month is subdivided in dekads as follows: 1- days 01 -
    #'   10; 2- days 11 - 20; 3- remainder of the month.
    #'   \item `day`, the month and day of each offset are returned as "MM-DD",
    #'   preceeded by "YYYY-" if no `era` is specified.
    #' }
    #'
    #' It is not possible to create a factor for a period that is shorter than
    #' the temporal resolution of the calendar. As an example, if the calendar
    #' has a monthly unit, a dekad or day factor cannot be created.
    #'
    #' Creating factors for other periods is not supported by this method.
    #' Factors based on the timestamp information and not dependent on the
    #' calendar can trivially be constructed from the output of the
    #' [as_timestamp()] function.
    #'
    #' For non-era factors the attribute 'CFTime' of the result contains a
    #' `CFTime` instance that is valid for the result of applying the factor to
    #' a resource that this instance is associated with. In other words, if
    #' `CFTime` instance 'At' describes the temporal dimension of resource 'A'
    #' and a factor 'Af' is generated from `Af <- At$factor()`, then
    #' `Bt <- attr(Af, "CFTime")` describes the temporal dimension of the result
    #' of, say, `B <- apply(A, 1:2, tapply, Af, FUN)`. The 'CFTime' attribute is
    #' `NULL` for era factors.
    #'
    #' @param period character. A character string with one of the values
    #'   "year", "season", "quarter", "month" (the default), "dekad" or "day".
    #' @param era numeric or list, optional. Vector of years for which to
    #'   construct the factor, or a list whose elements are each a vector of
    #'   years. If `era` is not specified, the factor will use the entire time
    #'   series for the factor.
    #' @return If `era` is a single vector or not specified, a factor with a
    #'   length equal to the number of offsets in this instance. If `era` is a
    #'   list, a list with the same number of elements and names as `era`,
    #'   each containing a factor. Elements in the factor will be set to `NA`
    #'   for time series values outside of the range of specified years.
    #'
    #'   The factor, or factors in the list, have attributes 'period', 'era'
    #'   and 'CFTime'. Attribute 'period' holds the value of the `period`
    #'   argument. Attribute 'era' indicates the number of years that are
    #'   included in the era, or -1 if no `era` is provided. Attribute
    #'   'CFTime' holds an instance of `CFTime` that has the same definition as
    #'   this instance, but with offsets corresponding to the mid-point of
    #'   non-era factor levels; if the `era` argument is specified,
    #'   attribute 'CFTime' is `NULL`.

    #' @description Given a factor as produced by `CFTime$factor()`, this method
    #'   will return a numeric vector with the number of time units in each
    #'   level of the factor.
    #'
    #'   The result of this method is useful to convert between absolute and
    #'   relative values. Climate change anomalies, for instance, are usually
    #'   computed by differencing average values between a future period and a
    #'   baseline period. Going from average values back to absolute values for
    #'   an aggregate period (which is typical for temperature and
    #'   precipitation, among other variables) is easily done with the result of
    #'   this method, without having to consider the specifics of the calendar
    #'   of the data set.
    #'
    #'   If the factor `f` is for an era (e.g. spanning multiple years and the
    #'   levels do not indicate the specific year), then the result will
    #'   indicate the number of time units of the period in a regular single
    #'   year. In other words, for an era of 2041-2060 and a monthly factor on a
    #'   standard calendar with a `days` unit, the result will be
    #'   `c(31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31)`. Leap days are thus
    #'   only considered for the `366_day` and `all_leap` calendars.
    #'
    #'   Note that this function gives the number of time units in each level of
    #'   the factor - the actual number of data points in the time series per
    #'   factor level may be different. Use [CFfactor_coverage()] to determine
